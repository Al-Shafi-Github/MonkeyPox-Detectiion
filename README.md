# MonkeyPox-Detection Using Machine Learning Approach and Explainable AI
MonkeyPox Detection Using Machine Learning Approach and Explainable AI

CSE445 is an introductory course on Macchine Learning, which was offered by [DR. RIASAT KHAN](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/riasat-khan/) during FALL 2022 semester at North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. This repository contains the Project and other projet related assignments that were completed during this course.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Monkeypox is a rare viral disease that causes skin rashes and flu-like symptoms.
  Key symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment.
</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>

<h3>Pre-processing</h3>
<p>Before training the models, we applied two pre-processing techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplicate Drop: Removed duplicate rows from the dataset.</li>
  <li>Null Value Drop: Eliminated rows with missing values.</li>
  <li>One Hot Encoding</li>
  <li>Feature Selection: Selected relevant features for training.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>We have conducted EDA on the dataset and generated images that provide valuable insights.</p>

<h3>Co-relation Matrix</h3>
<p>To understand the relationships between different features, we present the correlation matrix </p>

<h3>Machine Learning Algorithms Used</h3>
<p>We experimented with the following algorithms for MonkeyPox detection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li>Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grid Search and Random Search</h3>
<p>We used Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter tuning in our models.</p>
<p>Grid Search exhaustively searches over a predefined hyperparameter space, while Random Search selects hyperparameters randomly.</p>

<h3>Confusion Matrix</h3>
<p>The confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool for classification models.</p>
<p>It helps us understand true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.</p>

<h3>Explainable AI</h3>
<p>Explainable AI helps us understand how our models make predictions.</p>
<p>It provides insights into the reasons behind model decisions, increasing transparency and trust.</p>
